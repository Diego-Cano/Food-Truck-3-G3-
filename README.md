# Food-Truck-3-G3-
Repo for our class IT262 1VH 21252

For our second group project we'll be  building a PHP application that allows a user to select items from a menu as if they are ordering from a food truck.

Classes Required, Data Driven By Objects: Data for the food truck items must be stored in objects. Important Requirement - Changing the objects and their properties must change the form and totals in the form handler.  Do not build your form and form handler statically, meaning so that it always and only supports one set of values!  Here's the example code we created in class, the Item class and objects (Links to an external site.)

The application must:

Allow items to be chosen from a form
Display the items chosen and add and display the total cost
Allow more than one of each item to be purchased
Each item must have at least a name, description and price
Disallow incorrect data and provide feedback, for example, when a user inputs a string, the data is not processed and the user is informed of the mistake.
Be built as nearly as possible to PSR-1 (Links to an external site.) and PSR-2 (Links to an external site.) standards
